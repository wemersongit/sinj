* [#16937](http://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/16937): The `command` parameter in [CKEDITOR.editor.getCommandKeystroke](http://docs.ckeditor.dev/#!/api/CKEDITOR.editor-method-getCommandKeystroke) now also accepts a command name as an argument.

The issue was originally reported as a security issue by [Sriramk21](https://twitter.com/sriramk21) from Pegasystems and was later downgraded by the security team into a normal issue due to the requirement of having ACF turned off. Disabling [Advanced Content Filter](http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter) is against [security best practices](http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/guide/dev_best_practices-section-security), so the problem described above has not been considered a security issue as such.
